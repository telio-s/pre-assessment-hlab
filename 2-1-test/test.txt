Used for memorizing function, preventing the re-creation of the function
on every render. This hook could be used to prevent unnecessary re-rendering
for example, components will re-render when states/props changed, meaning
if these is a function in props, it will always re-render, however with useCallback,
the function will be memorized as the same one, causing the component to not
re-render.
