Additional Requirements:
- Validation
    I use ValidationPipe to validate the integrity of the data inputs

- Database Design
    To be able to store data for product details that supports multilingual, I created 2 database tables.
    1. products : Used for storing product informations such as price, category, product image link.
    2. product_translations : Used for storing the translations for product name and description of each languages.
    
    Then connect these 2 database table using relationship 1 to many meaning 1 'products' record can have multiple 'product_translations'.

- Testing Strategy
    I will use Jest to handle unit tests. I will use Jest + Supertest for automated integration testing and Postman for manual integration testing.
    For E2E testing, I will be using Jest + Supertest like integration testing, however I will make another database for testing with the entire workflow to avoid mocking data.
