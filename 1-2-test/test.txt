This is the performance test strategy plan that I will propose to the project manager.
	1.	Define Clear Performance Testing Goals & Criteria
To ensure accurate test results, we need to define key performance criteria, such as user concurrency, response time, load time, and transaction rate. This helps set clear expectations.
	2.	Set Up a Test Environment
The test environment should closely resemble the production environment to identify potential issues early. This ensures that new code changes do not negatively impact system performance before deployment.
	3.	Plan and Design Test Scenarios
Define key user workflows, test cases, and expected system behavior. This helps in creating test scenarios that resemble the real use cases.
	4.	Select the Right Tools & Integrate with CI/CD
Choose appropriate performance testing tools based on the testing criteria and team's experience. Possibly integrate some tools into the CI/CD pipeline to catch performance issues.
	5.	Execute Tests
Run the planned test scenarios, simulating various load conditions such as normal usage, peak loads, and stress tests to assess system behavior under pressure.
	6.	Monitor, Analyze, and Optimize
Setup monitoring system, such as AWS cloud watch, to monitor performance during testing, analyze results to identify bottlenecks, and make necessary optimizations for future improvements.
